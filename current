The current state of things is this:

Non-main global function calls fails because of the symbol lookup function. More
precisely, only local variables are added to the `symtab`, so local calls don't
recognize a function's symbol. This means the `Gen` monad needs a new feature -
it must also provide all new globally-defined symbols (presumably just one per
function definition), and `functionToDefinitions` must thread those values
through to the next `Gen`'s symbol table.
